Modules
=======

This library is divided into four modules, one that manages the retrieving of the file path of data files from your PC (**browse_and_choose_file_paths**), one that manages the creation, saving and loading of the data in a tree format (**build_tree**), one that provides the interface to the user (**user_interface**).
The last module (**functions**) provides some useful functions that can help the data analysis whit the implementation of things like Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.
