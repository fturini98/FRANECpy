===================

Description
-----------

This module provides a user interface using the functions defined in the modules **browse_and_choose_file_paths** and **build_tree**.

The main goal of this module is to provide via the **tree_call()** function an interface where the user could choose, starting from a main folder where the different data set folders are saved, if:

   - **Create** a data tree from the folders:

      - *tools-driver-out* for the **RAW** data.

      - *tools-isocrone-out* for the **ISO** (*isocrone*) and **RID** (*tracce ridotte*) data.
   
   - **Save** the data tree in the  *DataTrees* folder. This folder is automatically created when a tree is saved for the first time.

   - **Load trees** from the *DataTrees* folder.

**Attention:** 

   - **The biggest folder** that you can import are *tools-driver-out* and *tools-isocrone-out*.

   - **The names of folders** must be *tools-driver-out* and *tools-isocrone-out*, and inside that, you must have the standard folders ISO, RID, M *mass* provided by FRANEC program.
